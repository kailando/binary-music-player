### Binary Music Player

As the binary counter counts (upwards) each column is given a musical note. If that column were to have a `1` in it, the note will play as it changes.

The binary music player is based around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdaPhpGG6As" target="_blank">this</a> video which is using real piano sounds & sounds a lot more elegant - and is built with <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.JS</a> and some relatively vanilla js/css/html.

The creations are shareable /w url parameters, for example `?keys=G1,C^2,E2,G^2,D3,E3,G3,B4,D4,F^4`. These will update when you customize your own creation.
